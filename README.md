About Me

I am  Arham, a Computer Engineering student at Information Technology University (ITU), Pakistan. My primary focus is on backend development using C++, and I am passionate about learning and implementing efficient Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

🚀 Key Areas of Expertise:

Programming Languages: C++ (Primary), Python (Intermediate)

DSA Topics: Arrays, Prefix Sums, Binary Search, Hash Maps, etc.

Project Work:

Bank Management System: Built using file handling and object-oriented programming (OOP).

Student Library System: Features admin controls, file extraction, and user management.

Robotics and Simulations:

Arduino-based projects (e.g., object-avoiding robot, laser security systems).

Multisim circuit simulations for engineering concepts.

Shopify Store Creation: Exploring e-commerce solutions.

🌟 How I Approach Problem Solving

Understand the Problem: Analyze constraints, input-output requirements, and edge cases.

Design the Solution: Focus on algorithms and data structures that provide efficient results.

Optimize: Look for improvements in time and space complexity.

Implement Without Advanced Libraries: Prefer solving using raw coding techniques to reinforce fundamentals.
